Execute the git-workflow skill to perform a complete git commit workflow.

This command will:
1. Check for unstaged changes and ask if you want to stage them
2. Review all staged changes
3. Generate a conventional commit message based on the changes
4. Commit the changes locally
5. Push to remote if origin is configured

The git-workflow skill will guide you through each step.
